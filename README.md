# VR AlgoLab

**VR AlgoLab** is an educational VR game built with Unity, designed to teach young students core concepts in **Data Structures and Algorithms** through interactive and engaging minigames. By combining immersive virtual reality technology with game-based learning, VR AlgoLab turns complex topics into intuitive, hands-on experiences.

## 🎮 Overview

Explore a futuristic lab environment where students can walk through algorithmic challenges and solve problems in real time. The lab features **4 unique minigames**, each tailored to a specific concept in computer science:

- **List Labyrinth** – Understand and manipulate lists by navigating maze-like list structures.
- **Node Nexus** – Learn about nodes and pointers through interactive graph-building tasks.
- **Hamilton Hunt** – Explore Hamiltonian circuits by finding paths in a space-themed node network.
- **Binary Blaster** – Practice binary search in a fast-paced target selection game.

## 🧠 Educational Goals

VR AlgoLab is designed to:
- Reinforce understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Provide spatial and visual context to abstract concepts.
- Encourage exploration and problem-solving in a low-pressure, game-like environment.
